            <h2> II. Parking issue in MUNICOS</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p> The single way system predictable for fast movement within the city (at few
              locations) and restructuring the traffic has facilitated clear carriageways
              with deduction of parking from the roads. These have resulted in moving the
              “on street parking” to the other roads and to the spaces available
              surrounding to these roads.</p>
            <h3>A. Foot Path Parking</h3>
            <p> Parking on sidewalks or foot paths is prohibited by law
              but this is not followed.</p>
              <h3>B. The Parking on foot path by house dwellers:</h3>
            <p>This limits the foot path
              space for pedestrians and is wide spread in both residential and commercia areas of the city;

            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>C. Parking in front of the shops:</h3>
            <p> Basements which are meant for parking are
              put to commercial use and the visitors to shops/commercial establishments
              are forced to park their vehicles on roads;.</p>
              <h3>D. Parking by Automobile dealers and repair units</h3>
            <p> repair vehicles and goods
              servicing are parked on the road and the sidewalks;
              </p>
            <h3>E. Parking of vehicles around schools and colleges:
            </h3>
            <p> School buses and auto
              rickshaws used to transport the school children are indiscriminately parked
              on adjoining spaces including roads around the schools creating utter chaos
              and confusion; 
            </p>
            <h3>F. Parking around apartments and Business establishment</h3>
            <p>
              High intensity
              uses such as high rise buildings,
              Market complex/ Ceremonial halls or marriage halls/meeting halls have
              very little parking space within their property; a majority of the users park
              their vehicles on the contiguous streets and foot paths;
              The taxies, mini bus which operating on contract are found to be parked at places
              convenient to the owners, often on civic amenity sites, in the parks or any unused
              private/public land. These will need to be regulated. Individual taxi owners, Auto owners etc.
              park their vehicles on the road / sidewalks during the night near their residences
